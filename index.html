Itroduction

<p>
It's no secret that i love dinosaurs! But wich of these amazing prehistoric reptiles do i like the most. Here you'll find out! 
</p>

<h2>
Tyrannosaurus rex
</h2>

<p>It's definitely strange to see the tyrant this low, but here on my list,its at the very bottom</p>

<p>
Tyrannosaurus was a north american theropod dinosaur, this 12 tonne, 13 meter beast was the most massive land predator to ever exist, it was discovered in 1902, this coelurosaur lived in the hell creek formation, this formation stretches over portions of Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, and Wyoming, it lived in Maastrichtian age of the late Cretaceous, the very end of the age of the dinosaurs. Tyrannosaurus was an adept hunter,it had the strongest bite of anything on land, vision around 6.5 times better than an eagles and it also had smell comparable to a turkey vulture and could here as well as a fennec fox. it also had intelligence akin to that of a chimpanzee. This beast would make an easy meal out of anyone foolish enough to enter it's territory. Long live the king!

Herrerasaurus ischigualastensis
</h2>

<p>
This is a dinosaur you've probably never heard of. But today, you'll learn all about it!
</p>

<p>
Herrerasaurus was a genus of.... well its hard to say, it's classification has been all over the place, its been stated to be a early theropod, a basal sauropodomorph, and some even claim it wasn't even a dinosaur. but the safest thing to go by now is the idea it was a saurischian that wasn't a saurpod or theropod. This animal had a lithe, agile build for chasing down prey. It's boxy head is an adaptation for increased bite force, it also possed large arms for slashing at whatever unlucky herbivore it decied to eat. This reptile was around 3 to 6 meters long and weighed around 350 kg, it lived around 237-208 million years ago during the late Triassic period in what is now Argentina, South america, wich at the time would've been an open praire

<h2>
Torvosaurus tanneri
</h2>
<img width=400 src="https://images.dinosaurpictures.org/torvosaurus_gurneyi_by_atrox1-d791yy1_d26f.jpg">
<p>
For this one, we will go to the most famous era of the Mesozoic, The Jurassic!
</p>

<P>
Torvosaurus is a species of theropod dinosaur from the Late Jurassic Morrison Formation of North America. It is known from the Carnegie Quarry at Dinosaur National Monument from a single bone, the humerus. This upper arm bone is more robust and straighter than its more common contemporary, Allosaurus. Torvosaurus was likely the largest theropod in the Morrison Formation. It also had a much stronger bite than its contemperaries, this was mainly due to competiton, as torvosaurus ost likely hunted different prey and might have even eaten diffrent parts of a carcass

<p>
This animal comes from a family known as "walking sausages" by the paleo community, and this one is a oddball in a family of oddbals!
</p>

<P>
Carnotaurus was a predatory dinosaur. It lived 70 million years ago on the Cretaceous period. It was a large theropod which lived in South America. The skeleton, found in 1984, was uncovered in Argentina. Carnotaurus was a lightly built, bipedal predator, 8m in length and weighing 2 metric tons. Carnotaurus was highly specialized and distinctive. It had horns above the eyes, a feature not seen in other carnivorous dinosaurs, and a very deep skull sitting on a muscular neck. Also, it had small, vestigial forelimbs, smaller even than those of Tyrannosaurus.
The distinctive horns and muscular neck may have been used in fighting rivals of its own species. Rivals may have fought with quick head blows, by slow pushes with the upper sides of their skulls, or by ramming each other head-on, using their horns as shock  Carnotaurus was well adapted for running and was possibly one of the fastest large theropods, though it could not make sharp turns.

Vallibonavenatrix cani 
</h2>

<p>
This animal, the Vallibonavenatrix is quite a newly discovered creature, here we can get to know it!
</p>
 

 <p>
 Vallibonavenatrix was a large bipedal predator.it was part iof a familiy known as spinosauids, this creature was among the largest of this familiy, it was discoverd in the Province of Castellón, Spain. It is theorised that this animal is closley related to the english dinosaurs Riprovenator and Ceratasuchops, and like its relatives, it would mainly feast on aquatic prey, however, Vallibonavenatrix shows more adaptations to hunting prey on land, though it's diet still mainly consited of fish

<h2>
Styracosaurus albertensis
</h2>
<img width=400 src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FS3r4yUXEAMTKIU?format=jpg&name=small">
<p>
Finally, an herbivore, this may be the second most famous member of its family, after triceratops of course
</p>

<P>
Like i mentioned earlier, this dino is in the same family as triceratops, and you can definatley see the similarities, but you can also spot a lot of differnces! Styracosaurus was a relatively large dinosaur, reaching lengths of 5–5.5 metres and weighing about 1.8–2.7  tons. Styracosaurus possessed four short legs and a bulky body. Its tail was rather short. The skull had a beak and shearing cheek teeth arranged in continuous dental batteries, suggesting that the animal sliced up plants. Like other ceratopsians, this dinosaur may have been a herd animal, travelling in large groups.

<h2>
Pachyrhinosaurus lakustai
</h2>

<img width=400 src=https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-QIoIvGRR_2k/VNdq4zGqtTI/AAAAAAAABdc/ARn2WY92hbM/s1600/Woollysaurs%2B2015%2Blow%2Bres%2BWitton.jpg>

<p>
Ah,another herbivore, this one definitely stands out, even in its family
</p>

<p>
Pachyrhinosaurus is certainly a strage ceratopsian, with a nasal boss instead of a horn. Three species have been found to belong to this genus, P.lakusta,P.canadensis(largest) and P.perotorum(smallest). P.lakustai is my favourite because of the row of spikes on its frill. This centrosaur lived in the northernmost parts of North America, some say that it had a wooly coat for warmth, this has been called into question in resent times, but hey, in my opion it looks much better! The largest Pachyrhinosaurus were 8 metres (26 ft) long. It weighed about four tons. They were herbivorous and possessed strong cheek teeth to help them chew tough, fibrous plants. Instead of horns, their skulls bore massive, flattened bosses; a large boss over the nose and a smaller one over the eyes. A prominent pair of horns grew from the frill and extended upwards, and the skull also bore several smaller horns.

Ceratosaurus dentisulcatus

<p>
We are back in the Jurassic, and this is my favourite dinosaur from that entire era
</p>

<p>
Ceratosaurus dentisulcatus is one of the three species belonging to the genus Ceratosaurus, the other two being Ceratosaurus nasicornis and Ceratosaurus magnicornis, dentisulcatus is the largest out the the three. The Ceratosaurus lived in both western North America, but also parts of Africa it shared it's habitat with larger carnivores such as the allosaurus and torvosaurus, it may have avoided compeition by hunting different prey or eating different parts of a carcass, it's teeth were incredibly long for a dinosaur it's size, suggesting it ate mainly the internal organs of its prey, unlike allosaurus that would mainly eat the flesh. The Ceratosaurus may have been one of the more medium-sized predators, so it may have needed less food than its counterpart predators.

Maip macrothorax

<P>
This animal looks quite plain, but you might be suprised by what family it's in!
</P>

<P>
One thing you may notice when you look at this dinosaur is it's big arms and large claw on its first finger, this is a diagnostic feature of its family, the megaraptora. Maip was the largest megaraptoran but had proportinally smaller claws, Megaraptorans are, suprisingly, Tyrannosauroids, but instead growing large jaws, they evolved powerful claws! Maip is from the Late Cretaceous Chorrillo Formation of Santa Cruz, Argentina. Maip is estimated to have been around 9–10 metres long and 5-6 tons, the reason it grew so large was because of the extiction of the massive carcharadontodsaurids, such as giganotosaurus and mapusaurus, in south america

Spinosaurus aegyptiacus

<p>
As we come to the end of our list, we have, quite possibly, the stragest dinosaur ever discoverd
</p>

<P>
I could write a whole page about spinosaurus, but ill keep this short. Spinosaurus was discovered in egypt by Ernst Stromer in 1912, back then our view of dinosaurus was much diffrent than today, and it didn't help that the remains were extremely fragmentary, and, also, the museum that held the origial remains of spnosaurus were bombed by the allies during world war two, fast-forward 102 years, Paul Sereno discoverd another skeleton, this one much more complete, this reveald some of the strange features of spinosaurus, like its M shaped sail, its crocodile-like head and it shorts legs, wich made paleontologists think the spinosaurus is a knuckle walker, like gorillas , the reason for theese features were quite obivous, this creature was the first aquatic dinosaur! but, then in 2020, the spinosauru's tail was discoverd, this made it that much more confusing, its tail was long and paddle like, wich balanced out its small legs, aditonally recent tests have shown that this creature was actually a lousy swimmer, instead, they suggest they hunted fish like a stork or crane. What a long and intresting histoty!
