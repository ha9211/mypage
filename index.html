  <h1>DINOSAURS</h1>

    <p>In a time long past, creatures roamed, Giant beasts, what's left is bones. Dinosaurs, they were known, Majestic and fearsome, all on their own. 
Tall and mighty, they ruled the land, With their strength and size, oh so grand. From the T-Rex with its mighty roar, To the Triceratops, with its horned galore. 
In prehistoric times, they did exist, In a world so different, yet so missed. Their fossils tell us tales of their past, A reminder of a time that didn't last. 
Oh, dinosaurs, we marvel at your might, In our imaginations, you take flight. Through books and films, your legacy lives on, Forever capturing our fascination. So let us remember, with awe and delight, The dinosaurs 
      that once ruled day and night. A testament to nature's wondrous creation, An ancient world of fascination.
