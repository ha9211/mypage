<p>It's definitely strange to see the tyrant this low, but here on my list,its at the very bottom</p>

<p>
Tyrannosaurus was a north american theropod dinosaur, this 12 tonne, 13 meter beast was the most massive land predator to ever exist, it was discovered in 1902, this coelurosaur lived in the hell creek formation, this formation stretches over portions of Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, and Wyoming, it lived in Maastrichtian age of the late Cretaceous, the very end of the age of the dinosaurs. Tyrannosaurus was an adept hunter,it had the strongest bite of anything on land, vision around 6.5 times better than an eagles and it also had smell comparable to a turkey vulture and could here as well as a fennec fox. it also had intelligence akin to that of a chimpanzee. This beast would make an easy meal out of anyone foolish enough to enter it's territory. Long live the king!

This is a dinosaur you've probably never heard of. But today, you'll learn all about it!
</p>

<p>
Herrerasaurus was a genus of.... well its hard to say, it's classification has been all over the place, its been stated to be a early theropod, a basal sauropodomorph, and some even claim it wasn't even a dinosaur. but the safest thing to go by now is the idea it was a saurischian that wasn't a saurpod or theropod. This animal had a lithe, agile build for chasing down prey. It's boxy head is an adaptation for increased bite force, it also possed large arms for slashing at whatever unlucky herbivore it decied to eat. This reptile was around 3 to 6 meters long and weighed around 350 kg, it lived around 237-208 million years ago during the late Triassic period in what is now Argentina, South america, wich at the time would've been an open praire

This animal, the Vallibonavenatrix is quite a newly discovered creature, here we can get to know it!
</p>
 

 <p>
 Vallibonavenatrix was a large bipedal predator.it was part iof a familiy known as spinosauids, this creature was among the largest of this familiy, it was discoverd in the Province of Castell√≥n, Spain. It is theorised that this animal is closley related to the english dinosaurs Riprovenator and Ceratasuchops, and like its relatives, it would mainly feast on aquatic prey, however, Vallibonavenatrix shows more adaptations to hunting prey on land, though it's diet still mainly consited of fish
